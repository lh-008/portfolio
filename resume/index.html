        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Python Image Processing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed and implemented core image manipulation methods like 
                negation, grayscale conversion, and brightness adjustment without 
                relying on external libraries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Developed a knn model using Euclidean distance to classify images, 
                incorporating robust voting mechanisms for label prediction.
            </li>
            <li>
                Dynamic app structures using object-oriented programming to track 
                user costs and provide exclusive features, such as advanced image 
                tiling and sticker integration.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>League of Legend Dataset Analysis</h3>   
        <ul>
            <li>
                Analyzed 150k + observations from professional League of Legends match data using Python (Pandas, Numpy) for data
                cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create visualizations with Plotly, to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships between game objectives and match
                statistics.
            </li>
            <li>
                Engineered optimal features to develop a binary classifier that predicts game outcomes, achieving an accuracy of 97%
                and an F1-score of 97%
            </li>
            <li>
                Applied hypothesis/permutation testing to effectively determine statistical significance and missing mechanism in the
                data.
            </li>
        </ul>
